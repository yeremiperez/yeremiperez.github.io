Mostly when I begin to research, the first tool I use is Google Scholar. I know it is widely used in many fields and is the most practical way (well, at least for me) to obtain a broad view of the complexity of the area. I click on the articles that may contain the information I want. Then I read the abstract; if I consider it could work, the tab remains open; otherwise, I automatically close it. Then I open another article and read it, read the abstract, choose if it could work, and repeat the same process again and again. After some time, I got many tabs open that I could not remember which one had the information I desired. I think I am not the only one who has been troubled with this issue. I really needed a tool to organize how I look for new information or read different authors or perspectives of the topics I am interested in. Recently I read an article in Nature about two algorithms that provide schematized scientific literature recommendations. I was impressed when I read the review, and I did not hesitate to use them.

##Connected papers

It is an extraordinary tool to explore papers dynamically. This software creates graphs with papers (included in Semantic Scholar) that are related to each other, considering the citations and references of each paper. First, you have to type the topic you are interested in, and the program suggests to you some articles. Then, you choose one, and this one will be tagged as the origin paper. Next, the algorithm measures how many overlapped citations and references are between articles. Then the algorithm constructs a graph where papers are connected to each other. The more related papers are closer, and the least are located far away. Alex Tarnavsky Eitan, Eddie Smolyansky, Itay Knaan Harpaz, and Sahar Perets are the principal creators of this fantastic tool. They claim Connected papers is not a citation tree, but it is kind of haha. In the following video, I show you a DEMO of how I used Connected Papers.

##Open Knowledge Maps

The second recommended software in nature article was Open Knowledge Maps. Let me tell you, this one is my FAVOURITE. Apparently, they work similarly, but there are some crucial differences. Firstly, Connected Papers use the Semantic Scholar database. In contrast, Open Knowledge Maps use PubMed and BASE (you can choose the one you prefer). Secondly, this algorithm only shows you a map with 100 papers (if itâ€™s the case, sometimes there is not enough content to offer one hundred articles). They are divided into topics based on the titles, abstracts, authors, journals, and keywords of the selected articles. The areas or bubbles are distributed regarding their similarity. The centrality implies subject similarity with the rest of the map. Also, the size of the subjects differs between databases. In PubMed, the size is determined by the sum of the citations a paper has received. On the other side, when you use BASE, the size of the bubble is determined by the number of papers the area has. This software is managed by a non-profit organization based in Vienna with contributions from all over the world, so if you are interested in improving the code, just get in touch with them.

I do not recommend these platforms if you look for fundamental principles or articles published long ago. I consider you can get the most advantage If you use them as a source to get an idea of what is currently published. And how some research is related to other authors or articles that you probably overlooked. I think with these algorithms is easier to trace the origin of some publications. I hope you can find these platforms helpful. Let me know what you think about these.
