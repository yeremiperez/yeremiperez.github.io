Hi! 
My name is Yeremi Pérez

### Who am I?

I was born in a small town that surrounds Mexico City. When I was seventeen, I attended college at Tecnológico de Monterrey to study Chemistry and Nanotechnology Engineering. During those years, I was a member of two research groups; the first, Neuroengineering and Neuroacoustics Research group, I led a project about correlating physiological signals (electroencephalography, electromyography, and electrodermal activity) with emotions. In the second, Nanostructured Materials Lab, I developed a sustainable synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles with applications in nanomedicine and electrocatalysis. After graduation, I got involved in consulting projects in industry to optimize polymeric formulations. Currently, I study a double Master’s degree in Materials Science at the Center for Research in Advanced Materials and the Queen Mary University of London.   

My research interests are developing innovative materials to improve neuromorphic and quantum computing and discovering new ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric materials.
